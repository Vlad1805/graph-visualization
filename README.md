Graph visualization tool using python3 networkx module for linux.
Run play.py script to open the program or run each file individually to generate the output.

# play.py script

This script runs all the algorithms that we implemented for this project.
The script uses Pythonn languange and
a few bash commands for the installation of pyhton-pip3, networkx and matplotlib.

â¬¤ How it's made:
In the play.py file, you'll see 4 functions:

~def loading_message(string, n)
    This function displays the 'string' message followed by 'n' dots using 'clear' and 'sleep' from bash

~def entry()
    This function formats the user input for the input.txt file. It creates a list with numbers
only and appends it to the 'matrix' list.

~def input_file(matrix, n, root)
    This function opens a file in 'write' mode and writes the dimension of matrix 'n',
the 'matrix' and the starting root.

~def input_print(matrix, n, root)
    This prints the user input on the terminal.

Choices:

              --- yes
1st choice ---|   or
              --- quit
    Used for the first question.


              --- yes
2nd choice ---|   or
              --- no
    Used for the second question, if the user has all the needed packages.
             

                  --- 1 -> BFS
              |---|
              |   --- 2 -> DFS
3rd choice ---|   
              |   --- 3 -> Dijkstra
              |---| 
                  --- 4 -> Floyd Warshall
    Used for the third question, when the user selects the algorithm.

              |--- input
              |
4th choice ---|--- example
              |
              |--- retry
    Used for the forth question. It generates the adjacency matrix. It can be done with the user input,
    one example for each algorithm or you can retry the selection of the algorithm (retry 3rd choice).

In the final part, the script runs the algorithm.py file and a window with the chosen graph in displayed.
