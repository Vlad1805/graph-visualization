# graph-visualization

Graph visualization tool using python3 networkx module for linux.
Run play.py script to open the program or run each file individually to generate the output.

# play.py script

This script runs all the algorithms that we propouse for this project. Is using Pythonn languange and
a few bash commands for the installation of pyhton-pip3, networkx and matplotlib.

â¬¤ How it's made:
In the file, you'll see 4 functions:

~def loading_message(string, n)
    This displays the 'string' message followed by 'n' dots using 'clear' and 'sleep' from bash

~def entry()
    This is formating the user input for the input.txt file. Makes a list only with numbers and append it 
    in the 'matrix' list.

~def input_file(matrix, n, root)
    This open a file in 'write' mode and writes the dimension of matrix 'n', the 'matrix' and the starting root.

~def input_print(matrix, n, root)
    This prints the user input on the terminal.

In total, they're are x choices:

              --- yes
1st choice ---|   or
              --- quit
    Used for the first question.


              --- yes
2nd choice ---|   or
              --- no
    Used for the second question, if the user has all the needed packages.
             

                  --- 1 -> BFS
              |---|
              |   --- 2 -> DFS
3rd choice ---|   
              |   --- 3 -> Dijkstra
              |---| 
                  --- 4 -> Floyd Warshall
    Used for the third question, when the user select the algorithm.
